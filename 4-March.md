- [x] ### How to get promoted this year

```txt
Tell your manager early on you want to grow towards the next level
```

```txt
How could I take on projects that would line up with the Senior 2 matrix?

What were the other Senior 2’s doing that I wasn’t? (eg. L3 on call)

What ways did I need to take more ownership of our systems?

How could I start working cross team to have more impact?
```

```txt
Do your current job well

Ask your manager how you can help them

Do what they ask

Ask your manager if you could help in a way that also grows your skills toward a particular goal

Do as they suggest, and repeat in a loop from step 4
```
